# ClimbingStairs

You're a rebel scout on the ice planet, Hoth. While killing time waiting for the Empire to find your base, you ride your trusty Tauntaun around the plant. You wander upon a very tall ice staircase leading up a mountainside that takes n steps to reach. Having plenty of time on your hands, you decide you want to figure out how many ways are there to reach the top. The catch is that for each step, your Tauntauan can only climb 1 or 2 steps at a given time.
Your job is to write a function 'climbingStairs' that will return the total number of ways you can reach the top.
'climbingStairs' should take the following parameter:
•	totalSteps: an integer, total n steps to the top.
Constraints:
•	0 <= totalSteps < infinity
•	For each given step, you can only take 1 or 2 steps at a time
Sample Input:
•	Given: 2
•	Output: 2
o	There are two ways to the top (1 + 1) and (2).
Sample Input:
•	Given: 3
•	Output: 3
o	There are three ways to the top (1 + 1 + 1), (1 + 2), and (2 + 1).
